# success_rate_of_restaurant_in_zomato
Predicting the success rate of a restaurant using different ML models

In this project I have performed:
  data preprocessing : removing the null values
                       changing the data type of features
                       creating a target variable
  data visualization: visualising the results for an operation performed on data
  Prediction: Predicting whether a restaurant in Zomato will be successful or not.
