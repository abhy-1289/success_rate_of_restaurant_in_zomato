# success_rate_of_restaurant_in_zomato
Predicting the success rate of a restaurant using different ML models

In this project I have performed:
  data preprocessing which includes removing the null values,
                       changing the data type of features,
                       creating a target variable,
and  data visualization: visualising the results for an operation performed on data, and
  Prediction: Predicting whether a restaurant in Zomato will be successful or not.
  
  Link for the dataset is given in the python file as a comment.
